Proofs

* Proofs: methods for asserting the truth
    There are many ways to assert the truth, ie. jury, experimentation, sampling, etc.

    A mathematical proof is a verifications of a proposition by a chain of logical deductions from a set of axioms.

    A proposition is a statement that is either true or false

    Upside Down A (∀) is the 'for all' symbol

    N is the set of all natural numbers {0,1, 2, 3...}

    ∈ is the 'is an element of' or 'belongs to' symbol

    ∀n∈N, n^2 + n + 41 is prime (happens to be true for the first 40 numbers but is false after)

    A predicate (n^2 + n + 41 is prime) is a proposition whose truth depends on the value of a variable

    a^4 + b^4 + c^4 = d^4 has no positive integer solution (false)

    ∃ is the symbol for 'there exist'

    ∃ a, b, c, d ∈ N+ for which a^4 + b^4 + c^4 = d^4

    Z is the set of all integers

    ⇒ arrow is the symbol for implies. An implication p ⇒ q is true if p is false or q is true. False implies anything is true, implication is only false if p is true and q is false. pigs fly ⇒ i am king is true because pigs fly is false. A false p implies all q.

    ⇔ double sided arrow is the 'if and only if symbol'. It means there's an implication going both ways. It is true when both p and q are true or false.

    the ∧ symbol is the 'and' symbol, while the ∨ symbol is the 'or' symbol.

    the ¬ is the symbol for 'not'.

    the := / =: / :⇔ symbols mean 'is defined by'. We can create predicate functions like P(n) := 'n is a prime'.
