Axioms:

* Axiom: a proposition that is 'assumed' to be true. (it means 'to think worthy' in Greek)

    Example: Given a line L and a point P not on L, there is exactly one line through p parallel to L. (does not hold for none euclidian geometry)

    Axioms should be:
        1. consistent
        2. complete

    A set of axioms is consistent if no proposition can be both true and false

    A set of axioms is said to be complete if it can be used to prove every proposition is either true or false (Godel's incompleteness theorem means that there will true theorems that cannot be proved)
